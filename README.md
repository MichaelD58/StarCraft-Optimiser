# StarCraft-Optimiser
A porject I worked on back in April of 2019 that remains up there as one of the most enjoyable to date. The user enters in how many of each StarCraft unit they would like and the program outputs the fastest way to aqcuire these units along with the build order and final time taken.

### Execution
Run with 'Java Controller' before entering how many of each unit you would want for the end condition
